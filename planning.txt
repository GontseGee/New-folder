STEP 1
Create the user's UI
-boards
-52 numbers with different color codes
-lottoplus option
-date for the draw and date of when the user purchased the ticket

STEP 2
create the Admin's UI
-an option to choose the winning balls(6)(it has to be randomized0.)
- the part to see who and how many people won the bet 
-the part for checking the total number of bets for those draws

STEP 3
calculations
- the total number of boards the user has selected * R5
-lottoplus = R2.5 so if it is Lottoplus 1 and 2 = R2.5* 2
- 
STEP 4
-generate 2 or more tickets if the user chooses more than 10 boards(max 10 boards per ticket)
-return an error message or something if the user chooses more than 6 numbers on a board(user friendly way to solve this )

STEP 5 and more to be added after applying these following steps to the code
